# C++ Module 08

This module focuses on templated containers, iterators, algorithms, and custom adaptations of standard containers in C++.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./ex00
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./ex01
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./ex02
```


## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Easy find:
Write a template function easyfind() that searches for an integer in any integer container. Return the found value or handle not found via exception or error.

ex01 — Span:
Implement a Span class storing up to N integers. Provide:

addNumber() to add one number

shortestSpan() and longestSpan() to calculate minimal/maximal differences

A method to add a range of numbers using iterators (for bulk filling, e.g., 10,000+ numbers)

ex02 — Mutated abomination:
Create a MutantStack class inheriting from std::stack but exposing iterators (begin() / end()). This makes the stack iterable like standard containers.
