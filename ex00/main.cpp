// You will notice that, in this module, the exercises can be solved WITHOUT the standard Containers and WITHOUT the standard Algorithms.
// However, using them is precisely the goal of this Module. You are allowed to
// use the STL. Yes, you can use the Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and the
// Algorithms (defined in header <algorithm>). Moreover, you should use them as much
// as you can. Thus, do your best to apply them wherever itâ€™s appropriate.

// Unlike sequence containers (like std::vector, std::list, std::deque), associative containers use keys to store elements in a structured way.
